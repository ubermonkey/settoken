      <h2 class="featurette-heading" id="info">Info</h2>
      <!--      <h3 class="featurette-heading" id="purpose"><span class="muted">Purpose</span></h3>-->
      <p class="lead">We will use cryptocurrencies (Initial Consensus Offering) for growth rather than traditional management, advisors, investors, debt, venture capital and shareholders. Our aim is to empower a community market of decentralized education services, without interruption or regulations except your own consensus, and accessibility to all including the utilization of tokenized scholarship programs voted upon by SET members. The education will be self-curated with only the best content rising to the top and being rewarded.</p>

      <br>
      <h2 class="featurette-heading" id="market">The Market</h2>
      <p class="lead">The great cost of education per year composes a $5.4 trillion global education market. Education technology is a rapidly growing singularity set to reach $250 billion by 2020 and encompass over half a trillion dollars by 2025 globally. According to market research firm iResearch, China’s online education market is poised to reach close to $40 billion USD in 2019, while the U.S. e-learning market size may reach $50 billion by 2020. As a testament to interest in the area, LinkedIn acquired the e-learning website Lynda.com in 2015 for $1.5 billion. Times have changed from when the traditional four-year college institution was the only option; going deeply into debt to acquire a lustrous (potentially overvalued) degree will be looked at as a way to limit student learning habits rather than empower people to continue learning and asking questions every day. Ease of accessibility and technology has improved the effectiveness of online, decentralized learning.</p>

      <br>
      <h2 class="featurette-heading" id="story">The Story</h2>
      <p class="lead">We created SET such that members can decide for themselves which topics are most relevant, practical, and useful for modern times through votes. The token membership is nominal because we believe education should be accessible to all individuals. For those users unable to access viewership to the best education content on the SET platform, the SET platform will enable tokenized scholarship programs by consensus for those that qualify. In this way, literally, any one of the current 8 billion humans on our planet Earth can have an opportunity to access the SET decentralized education platform.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">SET members will vote on the topics, and members will create the courses themselves through their own efforts with the most viewed and highest rated courses receiving the most tokens. Through voting, we can create content that is authentic, valuable, and original. The content will be autonomously self-curated so only the strongest content survives, thereby compelling the courses to be of the highest standards as recognized by users.</p>
      <p class="lead">Feedback will be instantaneous which improves learning. By providing real-time feedback and creating social connections through the virtual platform, SET members will be able to motivate each other, whilst testing their teachers through real-time views and ratings.</p>
      <p class="lead">The recognition of these diplomas, certificates, and scholarships will have already been vetted by SET and its members, and therefore, can be significant in the off-line world. Over time, the better the content, the more highly regarded the education until SET by definition becomes the best educational system in the world.</p>

      <br>
      <h2 class="featurette-heading" id="decentralized-education">Decentralized Education</h2>
      <p class="lead">SET has taken the concept of online learning one step further by shifting the power of decision making from the hands of administrators to the power of its users through a Decentralized Education platform. Traditional education, outdated content, and restrictive coursework did not work for the likes of Michael Dell, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg and it may not for you. Unlike traditional institutions in which the curriculum is pre-emptively decided and pushed upon students in high schools and college education systems, SET only provides content as recommended and voted upon by its members, effectively testing their teachers. This empowers the students rather than the teachers in a continuous learning process.</p>
      <p class="lead">Decentralized Education—The collective consensus of members decides on the content through a trustless process, and no government or corporation can override education or influence it. SET token holders are in control of their own education with only the best content filtering to the top due to the self-testing nature of the token system. SET token holders own their own educational destiny, and anyone can be a member as SET tokens can be readily transacted amongst members, and the outside community.</p>
      <p class="lead">We want to use the blockchain to disrupt the education system, and change the way knowledge is acquired by people of the world. Thankfully blockchain technology gives us the opportunity to embark on just that. This is why we structured the program to generate the best content naturally, membership is nominal, and all members are incentivized to participate in the network.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading" id="token-structure">Token Structure</h2>
      <p class="lead">To develop and run SET, we will need to be able to cover start-up costs, the operating expenses of the website, the incentivized content system, as well as capital expenditures. To accomplish this task with success, and execute this business model to the full extent, the Initial Consensus Offering procedure is necessary.</p>
      <p class="lead">For generation, 8,000,000,000 decentralized education members or SET tokens will be available to participants. The ICO for the SET token (SET) will be conducted using Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (XBT). The ICO will be directed for 800,000 ETH and 80,000 XBT. The ICO campaign will take place over a defined period until the generation of all 8,000,000,000 SET tokens completes, but for no longer than this period. If, not all 8,000,000,000 SET tokens are generated by the end of this period, the unrealized amount will also be placed at the disposal of the SET team. 8,000,000,000 SET tokens will be made available for generation through the ICO; generated each at an ICO ratio of 0.0002 ETH or 0.00002 XBT per SET token generated. The ratio will be 5,000 SET tokens to 1 ETH and 50,000 SET tokens to 1 XBT. In total, there will be 16,000,000,000 tokens in existence, while 8,000,000,000 of these tokens will be generated for the ICO campaign participants. SET token holders will be required to hold at least 1 complete SET token to hold membership to the decentralized education network.</p>
